This is a **free** and **open** Fivem script that uses ESX Framework. The goal of this script is to implement different type of shops on your server, that can accepts multiple types of money. These shops can be used as a pawn shop, a store, or as a buyer only.

## Usage

This script doesn't use an SQL database, instead it uses json files for each shop. these can be found under the
`data/` folder. This is how a data json looks like:

` { "gold": { "count": 5.0 }, "lighter": { "count": 17 }, "phone": { "count": 11 }, "vape": { "count": 30 } }`

You can edit this data even if the script runs on your server. Make sure the shop is not accessed by any players before editing these files. This data is only accessed if a player opens a shop.

### Images

Images are stored in `html/img`

Each shop has a logo at the top left corner. This image has to be PNG and has to have the same name as the key of every shop.

The products has to have the same name as the key of the items in the items table. These images have to be PNG.

# Last Words

Feel free to fork this repository and edit the script as much as you'd like. It would be appreciated if someone would edit this to work with other frameworks aswell. This is my first public script. It was needed on a server I'm working on. Have fun!
